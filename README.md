### Instruction

#### Main Page
- the main page consists of three columns: PAST LAUNCHES, LAUNCHES and MY LAUNCHES;
- the "PAST LAUNCHES" column shows all past flights. You cannot choose a trip from the past unless your name is Marty McFly ðŸš€;
- the "LAUNCHES" column shows a list of future flights. You can move the card with the flight of interest to the third column "MY LAUNCHES" with the mouse (the "MY LAUNCHES" column will be highlighted in ðŸ’š);
- you cannot move your flight card to another place;
- for canceling your flight booking - move the card back from the "MY LAUNCHES" column to the "LAUNCHES" column (the "MY LAUNCHES" column will be highlighted in ðŸ’—).

#### Details Page
- if you click on any card you will be redirected to the flight details page;
- you will see that design is not my strong skill ðŸ˜Ž;
- clicking on "Back to FlightShop" will return you to the main page. Attention, all cards in your cart will be saved and all data of flies will not be re-downloaded from the server.

#### Modal window
- each time you move a card between columns, you must confirm your choice in a special window. If you click No, nothing will change.
